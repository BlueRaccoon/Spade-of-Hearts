# Getting Started
Corps is an experimental tabletop roleplaying system which uses a side-scrolling combat map instead of the traditional top-down map.

Here are some things you need to get started:

### **Dice**
CORPs uses traditional 6-sided dice. You can find them just about anywhere, steal them from board games, get them at dollar stores, or buy them in bulk from a gaming shop. 

The six sided dice can be abbreviated as d6. If you see 2d6, that means you roll two six sided dice and add them up.

Players only need two dice. The Game Master might want more to speed things up, and it never hurts to have spares, but two apiece is enough to play.

### **Item, Trait, and Spell Cards**
To reduce the frequency of having to look things up, many aspects of characters (including spells, special abilities, and equipment) have been noted on cards. 

The cards are not strictly necessary to play, but they contain useful information.

### **Scene and Cutouts**
The representation of fights and interactions is very important in CORPs. The "Scene" is an image of an area with a 1-inch grid; the GM will need a number of these to show all the different scenarios that the player may fight in.

On top of that, players will need Cut-Outs of their characters. These are simply 2-inch tall, 1-inch wide paper cut outs to show the players' place in the Scene. The GM will also need a number of these to show NPCs and enemies.


# Stats
Your character has a number of attributes which represent their capabilities.

These first five stats rank from 1-5, in which 2 is the average for an adult.
- **Strength (Str)**: This is your character's physical strength and endurance.
- **Agility (Agi)**: This is a measure of your character's balance, reflexes, and dexterity.
- **Output (Out)**: This is a measure of how much magical energy your character can channel at once.
- **Intelligence (Int)**: This is your character's learning capacity, intuition, and mental quickness.
- **Move** : This is simply the number of squares (meters) that your character can move in a turn.

These next stats are special, and are not ranked 1-5 like the others.
- **Weight (Wgt)**: This is a measure of your character's size, weight, and his ability to throw his weight around.
  - The average weight for an adult is 7. 
  - 4 is the weight of a child, 2 is more like a badger. 
  - A weight of 9 is a very large person, a weight of 10 begins to seem unnatural. 
  - With a weight of 12, and you may be mistaken for a troll.
- **Jump (Jmp)** : This is the number of squares (meters) your character can jump upwards. In CORPs, unrealistic jumping is a staple of the game. The average score is 1.

The next three stats are the mental, physical, and mystic resources that your character has at their disposal.
- **Focus**: This is a measure of your character's mental focus and your ability to perform multiple complex tasks in succession. 
  - Focus determines how many things your character can do in a turn. 
  - 2 is average.
- **Health**: Health is the amount of damage that your character can take. A character has a number of "**Vitals**," which represents their ability to continue functioning despite taking damage. 
  - Each Vital has an amount of Health (equal to their Strength+1). 
  - The average character has 2 vitals with 3 health, which would be written as 3/3. *(See **Health & Damage**)*
- **Magic**: This is a measure of your character's magical reserves. 
  - Magic recovers at a rate of about 1 point per 5 minutes under normal circumstances. 
  - You may not use more Magic in a round than your Output. 
  - An average Magic score is 5.

Something else worth noting is your **Defense** - which is your ability to avoid being hit. Defense is equal to your `AGI+Fighting+2` *(For more about Fighting, see "Skills")*

# Skills
Aside from your character's physical attributes, they have a number of skills, showing their knowledge and experience in a subject. A character can have any number of skills.

A character's skill in a subject is ranked from 0 (completely unskilled) to 6 (master). 2 is an average skill level for a person reasonably familiar with a skill.

## Skill Checks
Most conflict in Corps is resolved with Skill Checks. A Skill Check consists of **Rolling 2 Dice**, then adding the relevant **Skill**, and comparing the result to the **Target**

- The **Target** is usually described along with the skill check, but if ambiguous, assume the target is **Seven**
- If the number you roll (plus your skill) is greater than the target, you succeed. If not, you fail.
  - If you roll the exact same as the Target, ask the GM what happens (Usually, either the Status Quo is maintained, or you Succeed with some form of Drawback)

### Half Checks
Sometimes you will be called to make a "**Half Check**". This is exactly the same as a skill check, except that you roll 1 die instead of 2. *Because of this, Half Checks are much harder than Skill Checks - especially for lower Skill characters*

### Bonuses
Sometimes (most notably when casting spells) there will be special "Bonuses" which enhance the things you can do - adding new effects when you succeed.

These bonuses each increase the Target by a certain amount, making it harder to succeed at the check. 

You may apply Bonuses *after rolling the dice*. This way, if you roll higher than needed, you can add only the bonuses you can afford.

## Primary Skills
The following are Primary Skills, which are generally important to gameplay. A character should usually try to have skill in at least one of these.
- **Fighting** - Fighting is your general skill in combat, both at evading attacks and landing blows. Fighting checks are used to hit enemies in combat, to parry attacks, and your Fighting skill gives a static bonus to Defense (Defense is `AGI+Fighting+2`)
- **Shooting** - Shooting is your general ranged skill, and covers all point-and-shoot weapons. Shooting checks are used to hit anything with a ranged weapon.
- **Throwing** - Throwing is your general throwing accuracy. Throwing checks are used to hit anything with a thrown object.
- **Perception** - Perception is your observational skill and awareness of your surroundings. Perception checks are used to notice important things, spot hiding opponents, and evade certain spells.
- **Stealth** - Stealth is your ability to evade detection and to be lost track of in intense situations. Stealth checks are used to stay hidden and to have enemies lose sight of you.
- **Convince** - Convince is used to charm, persuade, intimidate, and any other show of charisma or force of personality. Convince checks are used to bring others around to your point of view.
- **Mechanics** - Your understanding of mechanics and the general technology of the day. Mechanics checks are used to gain insight into machinery, and to build or deconstruct devices.
- **Magicraft** - Apart from the actual casting of magic, Magicraft is your understanding of the inner workings of magic, how enchantments are made, and the effects of residual or environmental magic. Magicraft checks are used to understand enchantments, magical effects, or most things supernatural.
- **Knowledge** - Knowledge represents your general worldlore, educatedness, factoids and trivia, and general tendency to know things. Knowledge checks can be used to learn incidental information, gain insight, or even attempt tasks you do not have training for.
- **Casting** (Specific School) - This skill represents your ability to cast a certain school of magic. Each school is a separate skill. A casting check is used when casting any spell from its given school. *(See "Magic" for more information)*

## Specialty Skills
Specialty skills are any other kind of thing that you might want to have skill in. Specialty skills can be absolutely anything, and can be used for things at GM's discretion. Here are a couple examples:

- **Weapon Skill** (Type) - This represents specialized skill with a specific kind of weapon. Skill in this gives bonuses to Fighting and Parry rolls with said weapon.
- **Craft** (specific craft) - This can be used to make, build, or understand a specific kind of craft, ranging from tailoring to blacksmithing to enchanting.
- **Schmooze** (Specific Subculture) - This represents your interpersonal skill and your ability to act naturally, get information, and overall belong in a specific environment.
- **Traverse** (Specific environment) - This skill represents climbing, parcour, woodswalking, and any other specific kind of skill devoted to safely and quickly traversing an environment.

Remember that you can make up any specialty skill which you feel that your character should have. Ask the GM how to use them.

# Magic
Magic is divided into a number of Schools, which a character may have skill in any number of. As a character gains skill in any school of magic, he learns Spells. A character may learn any spell related to a school he is skilled in.

### Casting Spells

Each Spell has one or more **Main Schools** and several **Support Schools**. You must have skill in one of the Main Schools to cast the spell.

To cast a spell, you must first pay the **Magic** and **Focus** cost, then make a Casting check using one of the **Main Schools** of that spell. If you succeed, the spell goes off, and you may apply any number of Bonuses related to Schools you know (depending on how much you exceeded the Target by).

### Learning Spells
You may learn a spell for free with the first point you put in a Casting skill. From there, you can learn a new spell with every 3 points put into Casting skills.

## Spell Schools
The following are a list of the common schools of magic. There may be more around, but these are the best known and most well supported.
- **Gravity** - Gravity mages can influence the personal gravities of people and objects, making individuals heavier or lighter, shifting gravitational directions, and at advanced stages even start distorting space or creating crushing gravitational fields.
- **Time** - Time mages can speed and slow small areas limited degree, boosting their own movements, speeding or slowing projectiles, debilitating opponents and at advanced stages even warp time/space
- **Entropy** - Entropy mages cause strange things to occur. Entropy spells are often difficult to control, and frequently have odd effects. Entropy mages are known to be exceedingly lucky, and their enemies seem almost cursed.
- **Fire** - Creation and control of fire. Fire mages are powerful and dangerous, dealing a great deal of damage and occasionally setting themselves alight as much as their foes. Fire magic has limited defensive use, but is very powerful.
- **Ice** - Ice magic manipulates temperature and creates solid ice constructions. Ice magic can debilitate, slow, damage, and obstruct enemies, and even grant armor and personal benefits.
- **Shock** - Electrical magic is wild and powerful, difficult to direct, and often stuns the opponent as much as it damages them.  Shock magic can also grant personal benefits, granting the caster twitch reflexes, manipulating magnetism, and just plain shoot lightning.
- **Air** - Air magic has loads of defensive and utility purposes. Air mages often glide and fly, knocking aside projectiles and blasting enemies off their feet. Powerful air mages can summon whirlwinds, fire debris at high speeds, and suck air from a room.
- **Shadow** - Shadow magic creates illusions, manipulates shadows, and sometimes can create solid forms of shadow. Shadow mages are experts at debilitation and deception.
- **Benediction** - Benediction is light, soothing magic which can inspire, soothe, heal, and create light. Benediction is sometimes viewed religiously, and has relatively few directly offensive purposes.
- **Earth** - Earth magic manipulates ground and rock, able to move boulders, shape earth, create walls or spikes, and even shake the ground. Powerful earth mages can create earthquakes, manipulate magma, and create entire fortresses from the ground.
- **Metaballistic** - Metaballistics is the magic of firing projectiles. Metabalistiers can shoot fireballs, ice shards, flying rocks, things which explode or bounce, and every manner and flavor of shooting things with magic. Powerful metaballistiers are nearly unrivaled in siege warfare and mage combat.
- **Solidics** - Solidics is the magic of solidifying magic. Solidics mages can create force fields, weapons and armor, walls, and generate forms from magic. Solidics mages have some of the most powerful defensive magic.
- **Alteration** - Alteration is about changing properties of others. Alteration mages bolster their allies and debilitate their enemies, but don't often deal direct damage.
- **Channeling** -  Channelers let magic flow through them, performing spectacular personal feats.

## Spells
Spell Cards describe the effects spells in greater detail, but each card generally has a shorthand in the bottom right corner that outlines aspects of the spell. Sometimes the Bonuses refer to this shorthand. Here is a short guide to what these terms mean:
- **Range** - This is how far from the caster the spell can be cast. A range of 1/2 does not count diagonal squares.
- **Damage** - The amount of damage that those affected by the spell take
- **Knockback** - Knockback dealt by the spell
- **Area** - Number of squares that the effect takes place across, and a description of what shape the area is
  - **Draw** - The player draws the area, choosing a number of connected squares (not diagonal)
  - **Concentrate** - The player can fill the same square multiple times
  - **Line** - Draws a straight line
  - **Sphere** - Make a sphere with the diameter listed. 
  - If a target takes up multiple squares in the area of the spell, that spell affects them multiple times
- **Defense** - A number of offensive spells don't create physical attacks that can be dodged or parried. In many cases, there is a special Defense which the target may roll against the Casting check of the spell. If the target rolls a Defense higher than the casting check of the spell, they are not affected.
- **Duration** - The amount of time the effect lasts. If the duration lists a number of Rounds, the current round counts (even if you are at the end of the round)
- **Effect** - A summary of the special effect that the spell has

# Traits
Each character can have a number of special abilities called "Traits." These traits are loosely grouped into a number of **Classes** and **Tiers**. 

A character begins with one free Tier-0 Trait, and from there they may pick up any Tier-0 or Tier-1 trait they wish. Tier-2 traits require that you already have 2 Traits in the same class, Tier-3 traits require that you have 3, and so on. 

## Classes

Traits are divided into **Tiers** and **Classes**. 

There is no penalty for picking up traits from multiple classes, but if you see a class that seems to fit with your character, it's a good idea to pick up a few traits from that class.

Some Classes may be hidden, or only available if a character meets certain conditions. 

 Here is a list of classes that everyone can access:

 ### Fighter
Fighters know fighting. Not just how to swing a weapon, but how to position themselves in a fight, how to condition themselves for intense situations, and how to handle themselves when things get rough. 

Fighter is a key class for anyone focusing in close quarters combat, but it's still useful for anyone who sees a lot of combat.

### Mage
Anyone can pick up a spell or two, but Mages can REALLY cast. Mages can shape their spells, use their magic more efficiently and effectively, and overall are handier with magic than anyone else.

 No matter your school, if you cast spells then a couple traits from Mage will be invaluable.

### Guardian
Guardians can hold their ground, and are *very* good at it. Guardians can take a hit better than other classes, they can resist knockback, and hit enemies on their own turn. 

Characters who plan on going toe-to-toe with something bigger than themselves will find Guardian very useful.

### Sneak
Sneaks like to avoid combat, confrontation, and people trying to kill them. They have useful abilities for positioning, evasion, and not being hurt.

Characters who want to be close to conflict, but don't plan on getting hurt will benefit from being a Sneak.



# Gameplay

## Health & Damage
A character can sustain a certain amount of injury and simply shrug it off without any lasting repercussions. Alternatively,  there is also a certain amount of injury that begins to influence a character's ability to think and fight. This distinction is represented with the Vitals system.

When a character takes Damage, they lose Health. Health can be regained with several minutes of resting (walking it off, nursing wounds, shaking it out, the like). However, when the character runs out of health, they lose a Vital. Losing a vital is a sign of having taken genuine damage, and each vital lost gives a **-1 Penalty** to all rolls. Recovering Vitals requires medical attention.

You can think of Vitals as health containers. When you lose all the health from one Vital, you lose that vital and move onto the next one. Each vital contains health equal to your Strength+1.

### **Being Disabled**
When your character has lost all of his vitals, he is Disabled. On becoming disabled, make a Strength Check (Target 7) or lose consciousness. 

If you lose consciousness, you may make a Strength check on regaining a Vital, when the combat ends, and every hour thereafter (All Target 7) to regain consciousness. 

As long as your character has no vitals, they are disabled, cannot Move, and have no Focus.

When you run out of vitals, you get one "Death Vital" which has the same amount of Health as your other vitals. If this runs out of health, you must make a check of your highest individual stat (Target 7) to avoid death. For every hour that your death vital is missing, you must make the check again at Target+1 per hour.

### **Taking Damage & Knockback**
Taking damage is fairly simple; when dealt damage, first subtract that much health from your current Vital. Then look at the attack's KB (Knockback)

If the KB is higher than your Wgt (Weight), travel in a direction opposite the attack (if ambiguous, the attacker chooses) a number of squares equal to the difference between your Wgt and their KB.

After being knocked back, Gravity kicks in (it would only otherwise occur at the end of your Move phase). If you fall, lose an amount of focus equal to the number of squares fallen. If you have no more focus to lose, begin Burning focus instead.

## Focus
**Focus** is a measure of how much a character can do in a turn.
- Focus can be spent to **Run** and **Haul It**, helping a character move farther than normal in a turn
- Focus can be spent to take additional **Actions** during a turn.

If Focus is **Burned**, the character is momentarily dazed or exhausted. Burned Focus takes 2 Rounds to return.
- When you have to **Burn Focus**, you can Burn focus which you have already Spent.
- If you are forced to **Lose** Focus that you don't have, you instead **Burn** that much Focus.

At the start of your turn, **Spent** Focus returns, and **Burned** Focus turns into Spent Focus.

## Movement
A character's turn begins with the "Movement Phase" - they choose where & how to move.

A Character can do the following during the Movement Phase:

1) **Move** : Move a number of spaces horizontally up to your **Speed** stat, and vertically up to your **Jump** stat (this can be split into any order)
2) **Sprint**  : You can spend **1 Focus** to move again up to your **Speed** stat (horizontally). If you are in the air, you first fall 1 Space.
3) **Book It** : After "Sprint", You can spend **1 Focus** to roll a die. On 4-6, move an additional space horizontally. On 1-3, **Burn 1 Focus**. If you are in the air, first fall 1 space.

### Gravity & Fall Damage
At the end of the **Movement Phase**, you fall 4 spaces downwards.

If you do not hit the ground, or have fallen for multiple consecutive turns, you are in danger of taking **Fall Damage**.

If you fall for multiple consecutive turns, when you hit the ground take Damage equal to **½ your Weight** and **Burn 1 Focus** for each turn you have spent falling beyond the first.

> ***Example**: You have a Weight of 6. You jump off a ledge and fall 4 spaces that turn, then next turn you fall 4 more spaces and hit the ground. You take 3 damage (`½ WGT`) and burn **1 Focus**. If you fell for one more turn, you would take 6 damage (`½ WGT`x2) and burn 2 focus.*

### Ledge Grab
If a wall is shorter than your character (or a ledge under waist-high),  you may use one Horizontal movement to instead move vertically. This costs **One Focus**.

You may also remain adjacent to the ledge (hanging on) and you will not fall, but you will be unable to use your hands until you pull yourself up.

This can be used to vault over low barriers, or grab onto ledges that are too high to jump onto

### Crawling/Ducking
You may turn your character 90 degrees (making them take up more horizontal space than vertical) in place of one space of movement. You cannot **Sprint**, **Jump**, or **Haul It** while crawling or ducking.

This can be used to take cover behind low barriers, crawl through narrow spaces, or give yourself an easier time of hitting short enemies.

## Actions

After the **Movement Phase** of a turn starts the **Action Phase**, where characters decide what to do.

A character can take one **Action** normally. Each action taken after the first costs an extra **1 Focus**. "Free Actions" do not count towards this limit.

 Some common actions include:

- **Attack** : Attack an enemy within range of a weapon. Costs **1 Focus**
- **Grapple**: Grab and attempt to subdue a foe. Costs **1 Focus**
- **Hand to Hand**: Attempt a nonlethal maneuver such as Punching/Kicking, Shoving, or Tackling. Costs **1 Focus**

### **Attacking**
Use a Held Weapon to attack a target in range. **Costs 1 Focus**.
1) The Attacker rolls a **Fighting** check against the target's **Defense**
   - Defense = `3 + AGI + ½Fighting`
2) The target may **React** if they have an appropriate Trait (such as "Parrying" the attack)
3) If the attacker succeeds, he deals the weapon's damage and rolls **Crits**
