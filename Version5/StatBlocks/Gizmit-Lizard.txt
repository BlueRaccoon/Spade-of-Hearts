#	Magic	#
Mana: Distortion 4
[T2•Dis](Size Warp)
	◆ Create and leap through a special portal (leading up to 4m away). When leaving the portal, you are a new size (between Tiny/0 and Large/4). You do not recover Health, Mana, or Strain from rest while size-shifted (as though Concentrating)
	◇ Leap through a portal 1m away that reverts you to your original size (Cast for free)
[T1•Dis](Slipstream) Create and leap through an adjacent portal, leading to a space you can see. No other creatures can use or leap through the portal, neither can objects S3 or larger.
	◇ Portal up to 3m away, then move normally
	◆ Portal up to 6m away, then move normally
	Enhance:
	↻ Leap into a portal to evade an attack. If your SpellRoll > AttackRoll, warp 3m away.
[T1•Dis](Warp Strike)
	◇ Create a portal leading to a space up to 3m away. Once this round, you can attack as though standing in that space.
	Enhance: An adjacent ally can attack through the portal instead.
