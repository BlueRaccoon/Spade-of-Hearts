# Scarecrow Arsonist
Tier 2 • Medium(3) • Animate (Scarecrow Pyromancer)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/muTt1Qe.jpg" height=200 alt="Scarecrow">

> Once, in a small and peaceful field, a Scarecrow quietly comes to life. Uncertain, it cautiously observs its surroundings - remaining perfectly still.
> 
> Over the weeks, through misunderstanding or real danger, it becomes gripped in paranoia - posessed of the fear that it would be burned alive if anyone found out. Each day it stays still, telling itself stories of the terrible things that would happen if it was discovered. Whether through dark bargain, obsessive study, or an ironic talent - the scarecrow's fear turns into a terrible magical strength.
> 
> It finally turns its fear outwards into the world - torching its home field and the surrounding village to the ground. It stumbles out into the night, quietly resolving to do the same anywhere it imagines that people might judge or fear it.
> 
> The Scarecrow holds a devastating command over Fire, despite being quite flammable itself. In this way, its desperation to protect itself only brings about its greatest fears.

## Equinox Form 

> *A special event; a creature has drawn upon a powerful Shadow of Change & Upheaval, and is posessed by the Equinox*

 A Dark Horse gallops in circles around the area, visible only as a faint outline in shadows, driving the need for violent change and upheaval in one creature. The character it possesses can not reason or retreat after drawing on it, and it remains possessed until fully incapacitated.

Each round, the posessed character draws an extra Card, taking an additional Turn each round.

Each turn, draw 1 Card (+1 per Injury) for one of the following effects

- **Hearts** — Create a Blast of Shadow in an area, deals `1d6 Mental` (`-Will`) and recovering Health equal to damage dealt. *Face: +1d6 extra damage*
- **Diamond** — Floating eyes peek out from shadows (hold onto card). Use to reduce one die roll by 1d6, (or use immediately to break free from an effect) after which the eye shatters *Face: If roll reduced below 6, target is Stunned*
- **Club** - Create "Hostility" in a space with shadow; it acts at end of round *Face: It acts immediately as well*
- **Spade** — Creature Teleports 1 Area, makes a Melee Attack with `[+8]` dealing `3(4)+Keen` Rend damage (in either order). *Face: Teleport twice; attack has ADV*
- **Joker** — Your shadow teleports to a space you can see and takes a full turn. It has all of your stats.

### **Hostility** 
-  *T0 Void Spirit (Shadow)*
-  `♣3 ♠1 ♥2 ♦1` • `✚8 ⛊0 ⤩8 ♟3` • `<+2> Violence`
