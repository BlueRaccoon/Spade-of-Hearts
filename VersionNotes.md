# About Game Versions

**Spade of Hearts** is the name for Verson 7 of an ongoing project - previous versions being known as **Dieheart** and **2d6**

### *A Note to my Players*
You have likely played through a number of different versions of this game, through development - or at least heard about them. Much like other big tabletop RPGs *(Many people are familiar with the difference between D&D 3.5, 4, and 5th Edition)*, many numbers, mechanics, rules, and themes are common to all of the different versions - but there can be some trouble dragging things from one version to another without making any adjustments.

I've tried to make transitions fluid when I was able to, and you (as my main players) were often the testing ground for new features before they were cemented. This can make it hard to keep track of the different versions of the game! For clarity (and good old archiving), I've outlined a few notes about the most recent versions in this section.

## Version 5 - "**2d6**"

Rules were outlined in [This Booklet](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/Spade-of-Hearts/blob/main/Version5/BigLittleRulebook-v504.pdf), and Character Sheets looked like [This](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/Spade-of-Hearts/blob/main/Version5/CharSheet-Full-v503.pdf)

- The version first played by **Kylen, Lyra, & Cooper**
- Introduced **Character Advancement** - including building up your Skill Grid and Learning Techniques
- Used Grid-Based Combat, but introduced the concepts of **Close Quarters** and **Brawling**

## Version 6 - "**Dieheart**"

The rules are outlined in several places, but primarily in the [Character Tracker & Wiki](https://diehart02.tiddlyhost.com/), with additional rules found in the [2d6 Pages Wiki](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/2d6Pages/wiki)  *(including Hazards, Injury, and Medicine)*

- The version first played by **Maeve, Aedril, Prince, Frogg, & Glorduk**
  - Early versions of this system were tested by **Kylen, Lyra, & Cooper**, starting with the arcade cabinets of **The Arcanozone**, 
  - Transition continued through the **Second Splintermen Arc** (though some changes were being tested as early as the **Yun Shen Castle**)
- The primary change was the introduction of **Area-based Conflict**, replacing the previous Grid Combat
- Introduced the **10 Main Disciplines** that are still being used, and solidified the process of upgrading **Attributes** and learning **Techniques** on gaining Even/Odd Skills
- Built on the rules of **Basic Spells** and **Spell Forms** - though the only way to acquire Spell Forms was through training
- Introduced the mechanic of **Hidden Potential** - allowing skills to remain blank until being used for the first time.

## Version 7 - "**The Spade of Hearts**"

The rules are outlined on [This Notion Wiki](https://spade-of-hearts.notion.site/The-Spade-of-Hearts-7afcaa6705994aa3a55c58b530342a49). Character Sheets can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g_GEL06ol8gVpDAw489HefP-Jd6dnNOg1VVoNRLKnY/edit?usp=sharing), which also includes a **Quick Rules Reference** and **Basic Magic Reference**


- Replaced the 2d6 Dice system with a Deck of Cards: players draw Cards equal to their **Attribute+Skill**, and count each Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker as a **⭐Success** (or 'Star').
- Changed numerous Dice-based mechanics for use with Card counterparts
  - Replaced "Advantage, Disadvantage, & Fortune" with Bonus & Penalty - increasing or decreasing the number of cards drawn
  - "Defense" and "Stability" now have a Difficulty: the number of Stars needed to Strike or Control you.
  - "Crits" (previously occuring on rolling 6) now occur for each extra ⭐Star above what was needed to succeed (such as target's Defense)
