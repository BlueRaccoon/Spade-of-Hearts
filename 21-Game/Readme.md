# The Deal

The means of Conflict Resolution is a "**Deal**," which is effectively a hand of Blackjack.

If the player is attempting a task of arbitrary difficulty, that player is given a "Target" (such as 15, 18, or 21). The player must equal or best that number without Busting.

If the player is in contest with another's skill (such as hitting an enemy, sneaking up on someone, etc) you 'Deal' against them; you must reach a higher number than them without 'Busting' (exceeding 21). If you tie, that indicates an equal level of skill.

If either player draws a Joker, that joker is worth '0' and that Deal becomes 'Critical.' A **Critical Deal** indicates that the winner scores a Critical Success and the loser takes a Critical Failure. This will have in-game consequences, depending on the context.

### Blackjack

The goal of a hand of Blackjack is to get as close to "21" as possible without going over (or "Busting").

Face Cards are worth 10, Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 (whatever the player chooses), and any other card is worth its listed value.

To start, any involved players are dealt 2 Cards. In this version of the game, all cards are played in the open. The players all choose whether or not they want to be dealt another card, repeating until all players have held or Busted.

 If a player goes over 21, they have **Busted**, and immediately lose the hand.

# Damage & Attacking

When attacking a target, you pit one of your Abilities against one of theirs (usually Strength/Dexterity vs Strength/Dexterity). 

If the attacker wins the deal, the defender takes all the cards he played that hand as **Damage** - discarding those cards into their **Damage Pile**. If the defender wins and is able to retaliate (such as when both attackers are in Melee Range), the attacker takes all the cards he played during that hand as **Damage**. In case of a draw, neither player takes damage.

If a weapon or ability specifies that it deals "Bonus Damage", the loser of the deal draws additional cards from the top of the deck onto their Damage Pile.

When a player has 8 Cards in their **Damage Pile**, that player is incapacitated.

## Turn Order
When entering a Conflict, players and enemies each choose Cards to represent themselves. Those cards are shuffled together to determine the **Turn Order**. When a player acts, their card is moved to the bottom of the pile.

On a character's Turn, they can Move & Act. The GM has the final rule on how fast and far a character can move on their turn. Acting (including any action that results in a Deal) ends your turn. A turn should be succinct whenever possible, and should almost never involve more than one Deal.

## Delay
Some actions involve a "**Delay**". The character begins their task, and removes their card from the **Turn Order**. A number of characters equal to the **Delay** must act before the Delayed Action is completed.

If a character is damaged during a **Delay**, the action fails and they are placed at the bottom of the Turn Order.

*Delayed Skills are far more effective in larger fights, or fights where allies can cover for you. They are less effective in 1v1 conflicts where your opponent can focus on only you*

# Abilities
There are 6 Abilities (Stats), divided into 3 Groups. 

**Strength / Dexterity**  
**Endurance / Hope**  
**Wits / Power**

Each one of these Stats can be given an **Edge** - that player then gains an Edge when performing tasks using that Ability.

In different situations, you will be asked to test one of these abilities during a Deal. Sometimes you will get to choose the best between two skills, and sometimes you need to go with the lowest of two skills.

When testing a skill, you gain **Edge** during that test equal to your **Edge** in that skill.

### Abilities and Skills
When creating a character, first choose one group - you gain +1 to both of those abilities. Next, choose two individual abilities, and gain +1 to each of them. 

You should have 4 total points, and no more than +3 in any one Ability.

Characters can choose a **Skill** for every Ability point they have.

# Edge Skills

During a Deal, each character will have **Edge** equal to their highest Ability being tested *(with a bonus or penalty based on circumstances)*, which can be used on Skills. 

**Edge Skills** cost Edge, and each skill can only be used once during a deal.

Unless otherwise specified, Edge Skills can alter any visible cards (yours or your opponents) and can be used even after Busting.

All characters have access to 3 Universal Edge Skills. In addition, players gain Edge Skills related to their Abilities - one new skill per point in a given stat. Additional Edge Skills are granted with certain equipment, spells, or other effects.

# Creating a Character

1. Choose and write down your **Abilities** : **Strength, Dexterity, Endure, Hope, Wits, and Power**
   - Choose one Group (Str/Dex, End/Hope, Wit/Pow) and gain +1 to each
   - Give +1 to two individual stats. You should have no more than 3 in any one stat.
2. Choose and write down **Skills**. 
   - For each point in an Ability, choose a Skill related to it.
   - You should have 4 total Skills, in addition to the 3 Universal Skills. Jot them down.
3. If you have any points in **Power, Hope,** or **Wits**, you can choose to learn **Spells**. 
   - You can only cast magic if you have a matching Spell Tool in hand.
   - If you intend to start with a Spell Tool, you may add spells. Otherwise, you can leave them blank for later.
   - You can learn **Miracles** equal to your **Hope**
   - You can learn **Sorceries** equal to your **Wits+1**
   - You can learn **Pyromancies** equal to the lowest of your **Power & Endurance**. You also learn the spell **Combustion** if you have either Power or Endurance.
4. Choose your starting Equipment and Armor
   - Your Left and Right Hands can each hold weight equal to your **Endurance** or **Strength**. Items twice as heavy can be used with both hands (or Weight+1 if you have no Strength/Endurance)
   - You can keep one reserve item for each hand - this counts towards that hand's Weight limit.
   - You can wear one set of Armor. You can wear Armor with Weight equal to your **Endurance**
   - Some items are so heavy, you can only use them if you took the **Strength** skill **Weightlifting**
5. Choose some starting items based on the number of Pockets in your Armor. "Stack" is how many of the same item you start with, and how many fit in one pocket.
   - You can choose the same item more than once to carry extras
   - Items can also be kept in Hands, if you have a free Hand or Reserve Slot in either hand.
   - Incidental items (rope, misc. trinkets, etc) can also be carried in Pockets
