# About Game Versions

**Spade of Hearts** is the name for Verson 7 of an ongoing project - previous versions being known as **Dieheart** and **2d6**

### *A Note to my Players*
You have likely played through a number of different versions of this game, through development - or at least heard about them. Much like other big tabletop RPGs *(Many people are familiar with the difference between D&D 3.5, 4, and 5th Edition)*, many numbers, mechanics, rules, and themes are common to all of the different versions - but there can be some trouble dragging things from one version to another without making any adjustments.

I've tried to make transitions fluid when I was able to, and you (as my main players) were often the testing ground for new features before they were cemented. This can make it hard to keep track of the different versions of the game! For clarity (and good old archiving), I've outlined a few notes about the most recent versions in this section.


## Version 5 - "**2d6**"

Rules were outlined in [This Booklet](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/Spade-of-Hearts/blob/main/Version5/BigLittleRulebook-v504.pdf), and Character Sheets looked like [This](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/Spade-of-Hearts/blob/main/Version5/CharSheet-Full-v503.pdf)

- The version first played by **Kylen, Lyra, & Cooper**
- Introduced **Character Advancement** - including building up your Skill Grid and Learning Techniques
- Used Grid-Based Combat, but introduced the concepts of **Close Quarters** and **Brawling**

## Version 6 - "**Dieheart**"

The rules are outlined in several places, but primarily in the [Character Tracker & Wiki](https://diehart02.tiddlyhost.com/), with additional rules found in the [2d6 Pages Wiki](https://github.com/BlueRaccoon/2d6Pages/wiki)  *(including Hazards, Injury, and Medicine)*

- The version first played by **Maeve, Aedril, Prince, Frogg, & Glorduk**
  - Early versions of this system were tested by **Kylen, Lyra, & Cooper**, starting with the arcade cabinets of **The Arcanozone**, 
  - Transition continued through the **Second Splintermen Arc** (though some changes were being tested as early as the **Yun Shen Castle**)
- The primary change was the introduction of **Area-based Conflict**, replacing the previous Grid Combat
- Changed üõ°**Armor** so that each point could prevent **3 Damage**; 
- Introduced the **10 Main Disciplines** that are still being used, and solidified the process of upgrading **Attributes** and learning **Techniques** on gaining Even/Odd Skills
- Built on the rules of **Basic Spells** and **Spell Forms** - though the only way to acquire Spell Forms was through training
- Introduced the mechanic of **Hidden Potential** - allowing skills to remain blank until being used for the first time.

## Version 7 - "**The Spade of Hearts**"

The rules are outlined on [This Notion Wiki](https://spade-of-hearts.notion.site/The-Spade-of-Hearts-7afcaa6705994aa3a55c58b530342a49). Character Sheets can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g_GEL06ol8gVpDAw489HefP-Jd6dnNOg1VVoNRLKnY/edit?usp=sharing), which also includes a **Quick Rules Reference** and **Basic Magic Reference**


- Replaced the 2d6 Dice system with a Deck of Cards: players draw Cards equal to their **Attribute+Skill**, and count each Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker as a **‚≠êSuccess** (or 'Star').
- Changed numerous Dice-based mechanics for use with Card counterparts
  - Replaced "Advantage, Disadvantage, & Fortune" with Bonus & Penalty - increasing or decreasing the number of cards drawn
  - "Defense" and "Stability" now have a Difficulty: the number of Stars needed to Strike or Control you.
  - "Crits" (previously occuring on rolling 6) now occur for each extra ‚≠êStar above what was needed to succeed (such as target's Defense)
- The **Quick Action** is introduced, allowing any Action to be taken as a Minor Action, but treating all Attributes as '0' in the process. 
  - *This was made possible because of the Card change; players of any skill level can still draw ‚≠ê0.* 
  - *This also strongly rewards players with high Skills; Unskilled Players can no longer make 'Offhand Attacks', but Skilled players can perform a breadth of actions on their turn.*

## Earlier Versions
The rules for the earliest versions of the game were poorly documented, but many design notes and stats survive.

### Version 4 - *Untitled* *(2018)*
- Version 4 testing occured largely in 2018, and had no Character Advancement. characters were customized based off pre-made templates.
- **Jen & Robert** went on a Nautical Adventure on the **S.C. Salvator** during this version
- Introduced "Body Grace Heart Mind" as 4 Attributes
- Magic was still strongly in flux; 
  - There were no "Basic Spells", but all mages learned the spell "Cantrip"
  - Other magic followed the general structure of "Spell Forms".
  - "Spell Power" acted as early Mana (spend 1 per Tier of spell).
  - Spell Schools did not go on Skill Grid; magic access was limited by "Traits" (early Discipline/Technique hybrid)

### Version 3 - *Untitled*
- Shared much more terminology with D&D
  - Primary Attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Heart
  - Very different Skill list, but Skill Grid was very similar
  - Used Armor Class
- Introduced "Skill Grid"
- "Crit Damage" not yet developed - attacks dealt static damage, but sometimes had added effects when beating a target by 3 or more.
- Weapons have "Range" of 2 Numbers (ie: 0-1 or 2-6), referring to spaces on the Grid (roughly 'Meters')
  - "Range 0" translates to "Close Quaters" in later versions
  - Most "Ranged Weapons" have a minimum range of 2. Most "Melee Weapons" work somewhere in the bounds of 0-2.

### Version 2 - "**Corps**" *(2016)* 
- *(No relation to "Complete Universal RP System" - I think? it's been quite a while)*
- Very different from later versions
  - Experimentally, combat is played on a side-scrolling map, like a turn-based platformer.
  - Introduced "Vitals" (precursor to Injury system)
- Stats include Strength, Agility, Output, Intelligence, & Spirit
  - Secondary Stats included Health, Focus (ie Action Points), Magic (Mana), & Weight (Resistance to Knockback)
- Used a 'Point Buy' system to upgrade skills & stats
- Spells had a "Target Number" to roll. The result of your Roll acted as 'Points' to spend customizing the spell; much like later "Enhancements"
