## Puppeteer
> `[Ani Ill Scr Sol | Air Ert Ice Voi Wat]`

You create, conjure, or take control of a magical force that you can control. For the duration, you can control that force like a puppet.

As an Action, you summon the puppet within range. It has `♣3 ♠2 Hp:8 Ac:10(10)`. It is Size 3, and shares your `♥♦` stats. It can attack at <+5> Range 0-1 for 3(3) damage. It is not intelligent and does not act on its own, and it is too clumsy to make use of items or perform complex tasks.

For the duration of the spell, you can use your Action, Bonus Action, Reaction, and Movement for either yourself or your puppet. You can split your movement between yourself and your puppet. Your puppet can take any basic action (attack, grapple, move, etc). If you can no longer see your puppet, it is considered Blinded.
