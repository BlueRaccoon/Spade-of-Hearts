The whip acts as a Weapon, which attacks with ♣♠Fight (or +5, whichever is higher). It deals 3(3) damage, with Range 5-10'.

In place of an attack, you can attempt to Restrain a target (Size 3 or smaller). They can make a save immediately and as an action on their turn. The restraint can last up to 5 minutes with concentration, and you can not create another Lash until the restraint is released.
