# Detection
```
Use 	: 30 Seconds per Spell Tier
Range 	: ---
Area 	: 30' (per spell tier) radius sphere around caster
Dur 	: Concentration (max 10min per Spell Tier)
Save	: â™¦Deception/Security/Stealth/Enchant vs Spell Roll
```

For the duration, the caster is able to percieve certain things (based on the school) within the radius of the spell. This spell works through solid objects, unless they have been enchanted to specifically ward Scrying attempts.

Creatures trying to remain hidden and objects that have been intentionally obscured can Save against the detection. If successful, they are invisible to the spell.

Illusions that simulate 'Scry' senses have ADV to save.

### `[Ben]` Find the Lost
You can sense the location and physical state of willing creatures within range. This allows you to see allies, as well as creatures who want to be found. Creatures who don't want to be found or who are indifferent do not show up.

You can also sense the location and state of any object within range that was left behind with the intent of you finding it (or the general intent of being found).

### `[Enc]` Magic Sense
You can detect the presence of magic within range. You can tell the approximate location and strength of the magic. Enchanted objects appear to have a faint aura around them.

While this sense is active, you can clearly see magic as it is cast and learn the spellcasting stats of a caster.

When you cast this spell, you can choose a specific school or combination of schools. You only detect magic from those schools for the duration.

The range of this sense is 15' per spell tier.

### `[Scr]` Finding
When casting the spell, select an object or creature that you are familiar with (have seen/met before). You can sense the location of that object or creature within range.

You can instead attempt to find an object or creature based on a description, and you will sense the nearest object or creature that meets that description. Things found this way have ADV on their Save.

### `[Air]` Air Map
You learn the origins and directions of air currents within range. This allows you to to find exits leading to open air in non-sealed environments, as long as the path of the air current is entirely within range.

### `[Ert]` Stone Plan
You learn the floorplan of a structure that is made of earth or stone by touching a part of it. You can only sense the floorplan within range. If the structure is artificial, hidden areas have ADV on their save.

### ? `[Spr]` ...

### `[Wat]` Dowsing
You learn the direction of the nearest source of freshwater within 500' per spell tier. In addition, you can touch a source of water to learn its shape and depth.
