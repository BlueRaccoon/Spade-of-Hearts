- Cover an area up to 20ft (3 units) in Spikes. They deal 1d6dmg to anyone in the space upon casting, then become Difficult Terrain. Anyone moving across them rolls DEX/ATH DC9 or takes damage again. Anyone falling Prone in the area takes double that damage.
- Flying or hovering creatures and Tiny (size 1) creatures are not affected. Giant (size 4) creatures always take damage while moving over the spikes, after which the spikes are destroyed.

+3: Increase the damage of the spikes by 3 (max 6)
+3: Create Anti-Cavalry Spikes. Thich serve as Obstacles/Cover instead of Difficult Terrain (and do not deal damage normally), but deal deal double damage against Large (size 4) or larger targets who are charging
+6: Your spikes are now Giant Size. They are only Difficult Terrain to Medium (size 3) or smaller targets, but deal double damage and are not destroyed by Large (size 4) targets or greater.

Instead of Spikes, the area is on fire. It is no longer difficult terrain, but deals damage at the end of each character's turn if they are on the fire. Duration: 30 Minutes

[ICE]
You may instead choose to make the floor slick. All Pushes get +1, and require a (DEX/ATH DC10+Push) save or are knocked Prone. The ice melts in a day or so at normal temperatures.

[TRA]
You can immitate the effects of any other element, but the materials must be available in the environment.
