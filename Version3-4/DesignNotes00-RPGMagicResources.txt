MAGIC RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NOTES

~ ~ ~ ~ MP System (JRPG)
- Each charecter has a quantity of MP, usually comparable in number to HP
- Casting a spell costs MP based on the specific spell
- Spells otherwise function like normal actions
- MP is restored on Rest, and sometimes by special actions
## Pro:
	Easily balanced cost/power ratio,
	Caster can have many spells
	Good long-term resource management, not requiring constant rest
## Con:
	Very fiddly numbers
	Difficulty balancing numbers for both long journey and bossfights
	Casters become useless when out of MP (or while saving MP)

~ ~ ~ ~ Spell Slot System (DnD)
- Spells are divided into Levels
- Caster has a certain number of 'slots' at each level for spells
- Slots are filled with spells during rest
## PRO:
	Natural, comprehensible progression for mages and spells; good for leveling characters
	Low power spells not competing for resources with high power spells
	"Spell Level" acts as an extremely consistent/universal metric, for easy DM statting/balancing
## CON:
	Extremely rigid categorization of spells; heavy requirement for same level spells to be of same utility
	Narratively strange to run out of energy for weak spells but keep strong ones; requires setting justification to work smoothly
	"Recovery" mechanics are limited without breaking game balance
	Casters become useless when out of spells

~ ~ ~ ~ Focus Buildup System
- "Focus" or "MP" builds up naturally during a fight, otherwise similar to MP system
## PRO:
	Casters never become worthless
	Prevents "opening with big guns"; encourages narratively satisfying combat flow
## CON:
	No long-term resource management
	Requires delicate planning to balance alongside the Action Economy

~ ~ ~ ~ Cooldown System (Dnd4, MOBAs)
- Spells can be used at will, but each specific spell can only be cast every so often (usually at will/ per encounter / per day)
## PRO:
	Discourages spamming the same spell
	Encourages going through your full spellbook; finding uses for all spells
	Less pressure on spell balance, since each spell is cast only once per fight
	Easy to measure character strength by "number of abilities"
## CON:
	Spell Failure extremely punishing
	Requires many different spells in order to be a designated caster
	No narrative implication; no measure of "exhaustion"
	Punishing to have niche spells, since they occupy the resource of an "Ability Slot" even when not used
	Limited long-term resource management (Only worried about Dailies between fights)

~ ~ ~ ~ Blood Magic System
- Spells cost HP
## PRO:
	Casters never worthless as long as they stay in the fight
	Natrual encouragement for mages to stay in the back without deliberately hampering mage combat stats
	Casters have very dramatic risk/reward system available
## CON:
	Requires freely available healing to sustain, interfering with HP economy
	Has lore implications
	Makes life harder for Wizard archetype

~ ~ ~ ~ Skill Roll System
- Spells are just like Skills; roll your spellcasting ability versus the DC of the spell
## PRO:
	Casters never become useless
	Mechanical consistency with rest of game
## CON:
	Chance of Spell Failure extremely unsatisfying way to balance powerful spells
	No long-term resource management
