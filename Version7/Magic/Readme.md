## Learning Magic
A character can learn Magic by placing one of the **Magic Schools** on their [Skill Grid](../Rules/Skills). That character can then cast the two **Basic Spells** from that school, and gains **Mana** equal to the school’s place on their Skill Grid.

New spells can be learned through **Magic Techniques**; each one teaches a set of similarly-themed Spells of different Schools. A character can cast any of these spells that they have the appropriate **School** for.

> For instance, say you add [🌐Solidics](#solidics) & [🔥Fire](#fire) as "Good(2)" and "Decent(1)" skills. Your character now has **2 Solidics** and **1 Fire Mana**, and you can cast [Barrier](#barrier), [Shapworks](#shapeworks), [Embershape](#embershape), and [Fireplume](#fireplume). 
>
> If you were to learn the magic technique **Ward**, you could also use the spells **Shell Ward** and **Flare Ward**.

Some [Discilpines](../Rules/Disciplines.md), such as **Arcanist** and **Gifted**, have techniques that allow you to learn and cast magic in unconventional ways.

## Casting Magic
Magic can be cast using either `♥Heart` or `♦Mind` plus the relevant School. Each spell lists what sort of **◆Action** is needed, and how much **✨Power** the spell takes.

### ✨Power
When you cast a spell, you generate **✨Power** equal to your ⭐Success on the deal. You can then spend **Mana** to further increase the power of the spell.

If a spell says it needs "✨X", you can put in as much power as you want - the spell grows more effective as you spend more power.

 *If you do not generate enough Power to cast the spell, you must spend Mana if you have any remaining.*

### ⬆Enhanced Spells
Most spells can be "Enhanced" - if a spell has an option labeled `[⬆E]`, you can use additional **✨Power** to add new features and capabilities to a spell. *Many Enhancements can even be added more than once*

### 🧠Focus
Spells that require **🧠Focus** only persist while the caster concentrates on them. They cease if the caster loses focus, or can be dismissed at will.

You can only focus on a number of different effects equal to your `♦Mind` at one time. 

If you are **Disrupted** (such as when Injured), you lose Focus. You can draw `[♥Will]` to try and maintain focus - keeping one effect per ⭐Success drawn. If the injury was Serious or Deadly, the Difficulty increases.
