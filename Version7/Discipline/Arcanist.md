# Arcanist

> ðŸ“– This is an *Early Draft* of Arcanist - it badly needs refinement and testing. This early draft is likely too convoluted.

### About Inscriptions
Arcanists can learn several means of "Inscription" - a special means of casting spells.
- Inscriptions are spells that are prepared in advance, with preset âœ¨Power and Enhancements.
- Casting and Preparing Inscriptions does not requre drawing Cards - the spells have been cast in advance.
- Inscription techniques grant a special "Scribe Mana" used to inscribe spells.
  - Preparing an Inscription takes time, and uses 'Scribe Mana' equal to its Power.
  - A single Inscribed Spell can have no more than 3 âœ¨Power.
  - Scribe Mana is bound up in the Inscription, and only recovers once the inscriptyon is used
- Inscription Techniques let you study extra Schools or Magic Techniques that you wouldn't otherwise be able to cast
  - You can inscribe any spell you can cast normally, in addition to any spell you could cast with the extra schools/techniques studied

## Techniques

### Spellcraft
With a keen understanding of magic, you can cast magic using `[â™¦Mind+Arcane]` instead of the relevant School.

### Inscribe Tome
*You learn to Inscribe Spells into a Magic Tome, giving access to a huge breadth of knowledge at your fingertips*
- The first time you learn to **Inscribe:**
  - You gain a special "*Scribe Mana*" for Inscription, equal to your `[â™¦Mind+Arcane+Knowledge]`.
  - Choose 3 Schools or Magic Tecnhiques; you become Familiar with them, and can Inscribe as though you knew them.
- You can inscribe spells into a **Tome** - a hefty book filled with notes and spells
  - Inscribing a Spell takes ink, light, and ~10 min/Power
  - Any spell in a Tome can be cast while the book is open in both hands (or nearby, left open to the correct page). Spells must be re-inscribed after casting.
  - Others can use `â™¦Arcane` to attempt to read or cast from your Tome

### Inscribe Runes
*You learn to Inscribe Runes, binding spells into your own bespoke artifacts*
- The first time you learn to **Inscribe**:
  - You gain a special "*Scribe Mana*" for Inscription, equal to your `[â™¦Mind+Arcane+Knowledge]`.
  - Choose 3 Schools or Magic Tecnhiques; you become Familiar with them, and can Inscribe as though you knew them.
- You can inscribe **Runes** - spells carefully etched or carved into stone, wood, or metal.
  - Inscribing a Rune is an extended task (often needing tools and days of work), but runes are difficult to damage and can be etched into any object. 
    - High quality materials may be needed to hold multiple runes.
  - Runes be re-used; they recharge on their own each day, or can be recharged using any source of Mana (like an Artifact)
  - Runes can be cast when touching whatever object the rune is inscribed upon. They can be made personal, or so that anyone can use them.

### Inscribe Talisman
*You learn to Inscribe Talismans, quickly scrawling portable wards and spells*
- The first time you learn to **Inscribe**:
  - You gain a special "*Scribe Mana*" for Inscription, equal to your `[â™¦Mind+Arcane+Knowledge]`.
  - Choose 3 Schools or Magic Tecnhiques; you become Familiar with them, and can Inscribe as though you knew them.
- You can inscribe **Talismans** - Scrolls, envelopes, or slips of paper containing sealed spells.
  - Talismans can be inscribed quickly and cheaply - even as an Action if the materials are already on hand (leaves you Exposed)
  - Talismans can be cast while held in hand, by touching and reading them
    - The papers still need to be drawn into hand using 'Interact'
    - Multiple identical Talismans can be stacked together in one hand.
  - When used, they can be placed on an object. They can maintain a Focus spell by themselved for up to an hour if undisturbed.
  - Talismans are fragile, and burn up after being used

### Bind Focus

You can create a "Mind Gem" - a special artifact that can continue to Focus on a spell on your behalf. 

You can bind a spell you are Focused on into the Mind Gem as an â—†Action, and it will continue to focus on the spell on your behalf. You can no longer command, alter, or otherwise instruct the spell once this is done - it will continue as it was before.

A Mind Gem emits an obvious glow when active - anything that damages or disrupts the rune also disrupts the spell. In Conflict, someone can attempt to target an active Rune specifically to damage or disrupt it.

A Mind Gem can be prepared on simple, cheap materials quickly (using a pen, chalk, knife, etc). The rune can sustain a spell for 5 minutes before burning out.

A Mind Gem can be prepared carefully on sturdy materials (stone, quality wood, metal, etc), but this requires tools and time. The rune sustains a spell for an hour before burning out.

A Mind Gem can be prepared on specialized expensive materials (gemstones, silver wire). The materials are expensive, preparation takes days of work, and the rune must be tailor-made to one school of magic. The rune can sustain a spell indefinitely, but periodically must be given Mana.

> ðŸ“– There definitely must be a shorter way to convey this. This technique is just a chapter. 
> 
> ðŸ“– Also, not sold on "Mind Gem". Can it be a rune? There's already a thing for rune. Glyph? What are other words for "I made a tiny fake brain to think for me"?
