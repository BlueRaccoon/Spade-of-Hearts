# ‚ô† The Spade of Hearts ‚ô•

**Spade of Hearts** is the 7th iteration of the ongoing Tabletop RPG project.

The rules are outlined on [This Notion Wiki](https://spade-of-hearts.notion.site/The-Spade-of-Hearts-7afcaa6705994aa3a55c58b530342a49) - although this information is gradually being migrated here.

Character Sheets can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g_GEL06ol8gVpDAw489HefP-Jd6dnNOg1VVoNRLKnY/edit?usp=sharing), which also includes a **Quick Rules Reference** and **Basic Magic Reference**

## Change Notes

- **7.0.3** (Post "Kealohi's Chaos")
  - The term "Spell Form" has proved to be difficult, and obfuscates the process of learning new magic. Now referring to these as **Magic Techniques**
  - Trying to reduce decision paralysis for unused Minor Actions. Allowing "Take a Breath" to recover 1 Health as a Quick Action.
  - Renaming "**Vulnerable**" to "**Exposed**" - Exposed better captures the idea of leaving yourself open due to a momentary distraction.
  - Reframing how Brawling/Control/Edge works.
    - All attempts to Control a target always Draw against that target's Stability
    - "üëäEdge" momentarily reduces a target's "‚öìStability", and is gained by any unused or extra ‚≠êStars
  - Altering ‚öîDefense & Ranged Attacks; Defense now applies to all Close/Nearby Attacks (Ranged & Melee)
    - "Short", "Medium", "Long", and "Extreme" now refer to areas that are 1, 2, 3-4, 5-8 areas away.
- **7.0.2** (After Proof-of-Concept Testing)
  - Moving towards using the term "**‚≠êStars**" to describe Face Cards (in line with the symbols used in documentation).
    - "Faces" sounds worse, and added unexpected confusion about whether 'Aces' count as Faces.
    - While **Tier** (from previous versions) is roughly analogous, it's not exactly the same - Stars are much less tightly bound than Tiers. Beginning characters can, if very lucky, get ‚≠ê4-5, which would be impossible to do with Tiers in previous versions
