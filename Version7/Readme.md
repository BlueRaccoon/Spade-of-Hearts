# ♠ The Spade of Hearts ♥

**Spade of Hearts** is the 7th iteration of the ongoing Tabletop RPG project.

The rules are outlined on [This Notion Wiki](https://spade-of-hearts.notion.site/The-Spade-of-Hearts-7afcaa6705994aa3a55c58b530342a49) - although this information is gradually being migrated here.

Character Sheets can be found [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18g_GEL06ol8gVpDAw489HefP-Jd6dnNOg1VVoNRLKnY/edit?usp=sharing), which also includes a **Quick Rules Reference** and **Basic Magic Reference**

## Change Notes

- **7.0.3** (Post "Kealohi's Chaos")
  - The term "Spell Form" has proved to be difficult, and obfuscates the process of learning new magic. Looking to change how these terms are used.
- **7.0.2** (After Proof-of-Concept Testing)
  - Moving towards using the term "**⭐Stars**" to describe Face Cards (in line with the symbols used in documentation).
    - "Faces" sounds worse, and added unexpected confusion about whether 'Aces' count as Faces.
    - While **Tier** (from previous versions) is roughly analogous, it's not exactly the same - Stars are much less tightly bound than Tiers. Beginning characters can, if very lucky, get ⭐4-5, which would be impossible to do with Tiers in previous versions
