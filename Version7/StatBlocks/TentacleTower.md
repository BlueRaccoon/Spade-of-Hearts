> **[💟15] [🛡0] [⚔1] [⚓2]**

- **[+4]** **Flailing Violence** ; Awareness
- **[+3]** **⚖Transmutation** ; Endure ; Presence

🐲 **Regenerate** — Recover 💟 equal to your Endure at the start of your turn. Easier time recovering from Injury.

🐲 **Tormented** — Resist 3 Damage from Mental, Pain, and Fire. When you do, radiate 3 Pain Damage to all other targets nearby (who aren’t in cover). *Counts as a ⭐3 ☯Spirit/🕯Void effect; refreshes when Injured or after 1 Minute if broken.*

🦶 **Immobile** — Remains in place, unable to move. Unusually high Health (+Size/Endure).

🏰 **Spike Moat** - Protects itself using ⚖Transmutation to create a deadly moat (spikes, acid, lava, etc). around itself. Prioritizes keeping that space clear, and throws anything that approaches into it. Without flight or other support, there is only room for Close Quarters nearby the monster.

🐙 **Massive Reach** - Able to Strike & Brawl in adjacent areas. Basic "Thrown" range increases to [🏹Medium]

🦖 **Grand Monster** - Takes 2 Turns - first Eyes, then Tentacles. At  end of round, the Mouths take a single action (to bite or scream). *It does not hold its turn if no opportunities are available.*
