### Skills
- **[+3]** Strike ; Aim
- **[+2]** Athletic ; Will

## Features
🦴 **Rail Thin** - Ranged Attacks against you are 1⭐ more difficult if they use thin, piercing projectiles - as are Strikes with similar weapons (dagger, spear, rapier, etc).

## Attacks/Gear
- **Several Hatchets** - `[ 🗡️Mixed ] [ 3(2) ] [ Thrown ]`

## Techniques
🔹**Strangle** - While you have **Control** vs a Medium or smaller target, draw Opposed `[♣Athletic]`. Deal `[1d6(2)]` Suffocation Damage (or 1/2 as much Rend Damage if target doesn't breathe). Target can't speak or use Magic until breaking Control. 1/turn.
