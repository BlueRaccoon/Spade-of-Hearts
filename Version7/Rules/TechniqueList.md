### Census
**♾Trait - Wayfinder**

When you investigate a space, you can see telltale signs of life an movement. You can discern:

- Roughly how many entities usually inhabit (or pass through) a space
- The approximate size of those inhabitants
- Whether there are more or fewer entities in the space right now than usual
- If you are Familiar with a type of creature (Elemental, Beast, etc.) you learn if that type is present

*The GM may ask for a check (such as Knowledge, Security, or Traversal) to improve the quality of the information, but should have some answer regardless of the result*

### Vantage Point  
**♾Trait - Wayfinder**

From a position of higher ground, you can see keenly at an ususual distance.
- Your **Ranged Attacks** have increased Range (🏹Short→🏹Medium→🏹Long) when aimed at lower areas
- You can **🔹Search** distant areas that you can see as though you were Nearby - and you can search multiple distant areas (⭐-1 for each additional area)

### Whisperer  
**♾Trait - Wayfinder**  
*All things can speak, if you know how to listen*

Choose one Type of Creature to become Familiar with: Humanoid, Beast, Monster, Animate, Spirit, Elemental, Demon, or Shadow. 

You can reliably communicate with that any creature of that description; it can understand your words, and it can make itself understood by you.

You can also spend time tutoring such creatures in any Skill you know (at most 1 less than your rank in that skill), or any Techniques.
