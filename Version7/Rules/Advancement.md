Characters **Advance** by accomplishing goals, affecting change, surviving encounters, and hitting Milestones.

- Add a new "Brick" (Skill Slot) to the **Skill Grid** each time you advance.
  - Bricks are added in such a way that *there is always at least one more Skill in a given row than the one above it*, creating a 'Pyramid' shape.
- If you just added an **Even Skill** *(Good/2, Expert/4, Legend/6)*, you can add one point to an [**Attribute**](/Attributes.md "Attribute: Body, Grace, Heart, and Mind")
  - Attributes can only go as high as your best Skill - a character can't have 4 in any Attribute until they have a **Expert(+4) Skill**
- If you just added an **Odd Skill** *(Decent/1, Great/3, Master/5)*, you can choose one [**Technique**](/Techniques.md "Technique: Unique Abilities that distinguish characters") from your [**Discipline**](/Disciplines.md "Discipline: Areas of special experience that grant Techniques")
