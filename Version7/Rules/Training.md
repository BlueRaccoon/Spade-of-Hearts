# Training

A character can learn new Techniques and Specialties outside of **[Advancement](./Advancement.md "Advancement: Get stronger through experience")** through **Training**.

Training involves in-game study, observation, and practice. You must be able to observe the technique or specialty at work - seeing it in action, performing exhaustive research, creatively developing on your own skills, or having a **Master** to teach you.

## Training Sessions

When you first begin Training in a new Technique, note it on your Character Sheet. You will start with 0/6 of the progress towards learning that technique.

Once on the road to learning, you need to devote time and energy to **Practice**. This might take the form of research, tutelage, physical conditioning, or anything else that shows your character putting work in.

- During Practice, **Draw** a skill relevant to the type of training session you are engaged in.
  - You can decide what Skill & Attribute you use, but the GM may determine that a particular means of training is more **Difficult**. *You may need to use skills you are weaker in to make more progress!*
  - Having continuous training sessions, or training that doesn't vary at all, may also make progress more Difficult.
- If you have a **Master** present - someone tutoring you in the technique - your Master draws as well - adding their ⭐Success to yours
  - Anyone willing can be a master - an NPC, another player, or a mysterious entity that appears only in your dreams
  - The **Master** draws not based on their own skill, but rather on their teaching ability. This can manifest in unusual Skill/Attribute conbinations, like `♥Fight` or `♦Empathy`.
- You can **Push Yourself** to work even harder - Draw again (adding to your previous ⭐Success), but also take **[Strain](./Strain.md "Strain: Reduces one of your Attributes. Recover with Rest.")**
  - When trying to fit a Training Session into a small or impractical block of time, you may be asked to **Push Yourself** from the outset - skipping the first draw entirely
  - Depending on the circumstances, you may be allowed to **Push Yourself** multiple times in one training session, and your Master may be able to as well.

### Difficult Training

In some situations, Training may be unusually difficult. You might be learning a Technique based on observing an enemy in combat, you may be researching an ancient and lost technique through scattered manuscripts, etc.

- You may be learning the technique based on very little - such as observing an enemy once in combat
- You may be learning a technique from a master with a unique physiology that you don't share
- You may be researching a technique based on lost and scattered manuscripts, or piecing together information based on rumor and hearsay
- Your Training Sessions may take place under adverse conditions, or you may be training in a way that plays to your strengths

In these situations, the GM may set a **Difficulty** - this is how much ⭐Success you need in a single training session to earn a single Progress towards your Training.

### Maximum Techniques

You can only ever have as many **Trained Techniques** as you have learned techniques through **[Advancement](./Advancement.md "Advancement: Learn new Skills & grow stronger")**. *This includes Trained Specialties*

### Other Uses of Training

Training might be used to teach characters things other than Techniques and Specialties. These other uses of training aren't restricted by **Max Techniques**

- Research or Explore to become **Familiar** with a culture, location, or subject.
- Develop a **Blueprint** that you might use to craft or alter a type of item
