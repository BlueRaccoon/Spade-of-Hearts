# Techniques

Techniques are pieces of special and unique training or experience that grant characters new abilities - especially during [**Conflict**](/Conflict.md "Conflict: Turn-Based rules for Combat & Time-Sensitive Encounters").


## Types of Techniques

- **♾ Traits** are passive, granting new general-purpose abilities to a character or changing how the game rules affect them. Traits are always active.
- **🔷Actions**, **🔹Minor Actions**, and **🔄Reactions** give characters new actions during **Conflict**
  - *These abilities can all still be used outside of Conflict - though their usage may be less clear.*
  - *Remember that Actions require your full attention, Minors can be done quickly and without thought, and Reactions are done in spontaneous response to something happening.*
- **🃏 Stunts** grant powerful, game-changing abilities that can be done once per game session.
  - Stunts often work outside of the normal Action/Round structure of **Conflict**- check the stunt for when and how it can be used
  - Stunts can potentially be used again with the help of a **Joker**
- **✨Spell Forms** are Magic techniques that grant a character access to a set of Spells with a common theme or purpose.
  - Spell Forms only grant Spells if the character has the right schools of Magic - check your Skill Grid before learning one!

## Learning Techniques

Starting characters choose One Technique from their starting [**Discipline**](/Disciplines.md "Discipline: Areas of special experience that grant Techniques"). 

As characters [**Advance**](/Advancement.md "Advance: Improve your character over time through experience and accomplishment"), they learn a new Technique with every odd-numbered skill added to their **[Skill Grid](/Skills.md "Skills: Specialized experience that defines a character")**.

Over the course of a game, characters may also pick up new techniques from odd places - most often through **[Training](/Training.md)**.
